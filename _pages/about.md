I am a software engineering PhD student at the [Institute for Software Research](https://www.isri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr. Claire Le Goues](https://clairelegoues.com/). My research interests are primarily in mutation testing, program analysis and test generation, specifically how we can improve the state of quality assurance and testing in industry. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I attended [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I worked with [Dr. Milos Gligoric](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gligoric/) on the topics of mutation testing and test generation. We were able to apply mutation testing to the domain of formal verification, where we mutated proof definitions and used the results of this testing to detect incomplete specifications. For more details about this work and my other papers, see the [publications](https://kjain14.github.io/publications/) tab.
